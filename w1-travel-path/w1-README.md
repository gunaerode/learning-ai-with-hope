# Week 01 – AI Fundamentals

## 📘 Overview
This week focuses on **Artificial Intelligence fundamentals** and understanding **how AI applications are used in real-world industries**.  
The goal is to build a **conceptual foundation** before writing code.

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered
- What is Artificial Intelligence
- Difference between AI, ML, and DL
- Types of AI (Narrow AI vs General AI)
- Real-world AI use cases
- AI application lifecycle (high-level)

---

## 🏭 AI Application Flow (Industry Perspective)

A typical AI application follows this flow:

```
Problem Definition
        ↓
Data Collection
        ↓
Data Preprocessing
        ↓
Model Training
        ↓
Model Evaluation
        ↓
Deployment
        ↓
Monitoring & Improvement
```

### Example Use Cases
- Chatbots (Customer Support)
- Recommendation Systems (E-commerce, OTT)
- Fraud Detection (Banking)
- Image Recognition (Healthcare, Security)

---

## 🧪 Assignments
- Explain AI in your own words
- List 5 real-world AI applications
- Explain the difference between AI, ML, and DL
- Draw or describe the AI application flow

---

## 🛠 Practice (Baby Steps)
- Write short notes on AI terms
- Identify AI usage in daily life (Google Maps, YouTube, etc.)
- Create a simple flow diagram (text-based)

---

## 🚀 Mini Task
- Pick one industry (Banking / Healthcare / Education)
- Explain how AI can be used in that industry
- Describe the data, model, and output

---

## 🎯 Outcome
By the end of this week, you should:
- Understand what AI is (no coding yet)
- Know how AI applications work end-to-end
- Be ready to move into programming basics
