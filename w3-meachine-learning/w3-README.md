# 🧠 Week 3 — Machine Learning & Python Foundations

This week, you’ll enter the real engine room of Artificial Intelligence — **Machine Learning (ML)**.

You’ll learn how machines understand data, identify patterns, and make predictions — just like humans learn from experience.

From **problem identification** to **model creation** and **deployment**, you’ll walk through every phase of building a working ML project.

---

## ✅ What You’ll Learn

- How to identify real-world AI problems and match them to the right ML type  
  *(Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-Supervised)*

- Difference between **Classification** and **Regression** with real examples

- Step-by-step process of creating, training, and testing ML models

- Deep dive into:
  - Simple Linear Regression (SLR)
  - Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)

- How to measure model performance using:
  - SSE
  - SSR
  - SST
  - R²
  - Adjusted R²

- Build your first complete Machine Learning workflow:  
  **Problem Identification → Model Creation → Deployment**

- Understanding **training vs testing data** and why both are crucial

- Hands-on practice with:
  - Simple Linear Regression
  - Multiple Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Boosting algorithms

- How to use **GridSearchCV** and **Cross Validation** to select the best model

- How to **save, reload, and deploy** models with preprocessed input/output data  
  *(Hands-on assignment included)*

- Strengthening understanding through:
  - MCQs
  - Exercises
  - Agent-based case studies

## 🐍 Python Foundations

This week, you’ll step into real-world coding with **Python** — the most loved and beginner-friendly language used in:

- Artificial Intelligence
- Data Science
- Automation

You’ll not only learn the commands — but also understand the **logic and mindset** behind writing clean, smart, and powerful code.

## 🎯 By the End of This Week

- Confidently identify and solve ML problems from real scenarios
- Build, train, test, and deploy regression models independently
- Understand how to evaluate and improve model accuracy
- Apply ML logic across domains — HR, Business, Tech
- Complete assignments with full clarity on the ML workflow

> You’ll take your first big leap — from **learner** to **AI problem solver** 🚀
