## 1. TERM

A **term** is a single mathematical element.

Examples of terms:

- 5  
- x  
- 3y  
- -7ab  

---

## 2. EXPRESSION

An **expression** is a combination of terms joined by + or − signs.

Examples:

- 3x + 5  
- 2a – 7  
- x² + 3x + 2  

No equal sign → Expression

---

## 3. EQUATION

An **equation** contains an equal sign.

Examples:

- x + 5 = 10  
- 2y – 3 = 7  

Equal sign present → Equation

---

## 4. FORMULA

A **formula** is a general mathematical rule.

Examples:

- Area of rectangle: A = l × b  
- Perimeter of square: P = 4a  
- Speed = Distance / Time

# TYPES OF ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSIONS

## 5. MONOMIAL

One term only.

Examples: 5x, 7, x²

---

## 6. BINOMIAL

Two terms.

Examples: x + 5, a – b

---

## 7. TRINOMIAL

Three terms.

Examples: x² + 3x + 2

---

## 8. POLYNOMIAL

One or more terms with positive powers.

Examples: x + 2, 4x³ + 2x² – x + 7

---

# SPECIAL QUESTION

### “Square of 2” – Term or Expression?

2² = 4

It is a **TERM** because it is a single value.

---

# ARITHMETIC LAWS

## 1. Commutative Law

a + b = b + a  
a × b = b × a  

---

## 2. Associative Law

(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)  
(a × b) × c = a × (b × c)

---

## 3. Distributive Law

a(b + c) = ab + ac

---

## 4. Identity Law

a + 0 = a  
a × 1 = a

---

# LAW OF INDICES

1. aᵐ × aⁿ = aᵐ⁺ⁿ  
2. aᵐ ÷ aⁿ = aᵐ⁻ⁿ  
3. (aᵐ)ⁿ = aᵐⁿ  
4. (ab)ⁿ = aⁿbⁿ  
5. a⁰ = 1  
6. a⁻ⁿ = 1/aⁿ  
7. a¹ᐟⁿ = ⁿ√a  

---

# BODMAS RULE

Order of operations:

B – Brackets  
O – Orders  
D – Division  
M – Multiplication  
A – Addition  
S – Subtraction  

### Important:

Division & Multiplication → same priority  
Addition & Subtraction → same priority  

Solve **left to right**

Example:

10 ÷ 2 × 5 = 25  
8 – 3 + 2 = 7

---

## Summary

- Term → single part  
- Expression → no = sign  
- Equation → has = sign  
- Monomial → one term  
- Binomial → two terms  
- Trinomial → three terms  
- Polynomial → many terms  
- Indices → rules of exponents  
- BODMAS → order of operations  

# Like Terms and Unlike Terms

These concepts are used when we add or subtract algebraic expressions.

---

## 1. LIKE TERMS

**Like terms** are terms that have:

- the same variables  
- raised to the same powers  

Only the numerical coefficients can be different.

### Examples of Like Terms

- 3x and 5x  
- 7a and -2a  
- 4xy and 9xy  
- 6x^2 and -3x^2  

These are like terms because the variable part is exactly the same.

---

### Collection of Like Terms

Like terms can be combined (collected) together by addition or subtraction.

#### Examples

- 3x + 5x = 8x  
- 7a - 2a = 5a  
- 4xy + 9xy = 13xy  
- 6x^2 - 3x^2 = 3x^2  

This process is called **collection of like terms**.

---

## 2. UNLIKE TERMS

**Unlike terms** are terms that have:

- different variables, or  
- different powers  

### Examples of Unlike Terms

- 3x and 4y  
- 5x and 5x^2  
- 7a and 2b  
- 3xy and 3x  

These terms have different variable parts or different powers.

---

### Important Rule

**Unlike terms cannot be collected**

They must remain as they are.

#### Examples

- 3x + 4y → cannot be simplified  
- 5x + 2x^2 → cannot be simplified  

---

## Summary

| Type | Definition | Example | Can be Collected? |
|------|------------|---------|-------------------|
| Like Terms | Same variable and same power | 3x and 5x | YES |
| Unlike Terms | Different variable or power | 3x and 4y | NO |

---

### Simple Rule to Remember

- Same variable and same power = Like Terms  
- Different variable or different power = Unlike Terms

# Algebra Concepts

## 1. Open Interval in One Term

An **open interval** represents all real numbers between two values, but does not include the end points.

### Notation

(a , b)

This means:

a < x < b

Example:

(2 , 7) represents all numbers greater than 2 and less than 7.

---

# 2. Equation and Inequalities

## Equation

An **equation** is a mathematical statement that shows two expressions are equal.

### Example

3x + 5 = 11

The symbol used is:

=

---

## Inequality

An **inequality** is a statement where two expressions are not equal.

### Symbols Used

- > greater than  
- < less than  
- ≥ greater than or equal to  
- ≤ less than or equal to  

### Examples

3x + 5 > 11  
2y - 4 ≤ 6

---

# 3. Factor Out the GCF

### Problem

12y^3 + 15y^2 + 6y

### Step 1: Find GCF

The common factors are:

- Numbers: 12, 15, 6 → GCF is 3  
- Variables: y^3, y^2, y → common is y  

### GCF = 3y

### Step 2: Factor Out

12y^3 + 15y^2 + 6y  
= 3y(4y^2 + 5y + 2)

### Final Answer

3y(4y^2 + 5y + 2)

# 4. Linear Equation with Dummy Dataset and Graph

### Linear Equation

3x + 2y = 6

### Convert to y form

2y = 6 - 3x  
y = 3 - 1.5x

### Dummy Dataset

| x | y |
|---|---|
| 0 | 3 |
| 1 | 1.5 |
| 2 | 0 |
| 3 | -1.5 |

These points can be plotted to form a straight line.

---

# 5. Linear Equation vs Linear Inequality

| Feature | Linear Equation | Linear Inequality |
|-------|----------------|------------------|
| Symbol | = | <, >, ≤, ≥ |
| Solution | Single line or point | Region of solutions |
| Graph | Straight line | Shaded region |
| Example | 2x + y = 5 | 2x + y > 5 |

### Example Comparison

Equation:  
2x + y = 5  
Graph is a single straight line.

Inequality:  
2x + y > 5  
Graph is a shaded area on one side of the line.

---

## Summary

- Open interval does not include endpoints  
- Equation uses equal sign  
- Inequality uses comparison signs  
- GCF factoring simplifies expressions  
- Linear equation gives a line  
- Linear inequality gives a region
