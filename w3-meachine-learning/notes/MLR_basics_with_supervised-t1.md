# 🧠 Introduction to Machine Learning — Basics

This document explains the fundamental concepts of Machine Learning in a simple and easy-to-understand way.

## 📌 1. Domain Selection (Stage One of ML)

**Domain Selection** is choosing the real-world area where we apply Machine Learning.

Examples:
- Healthcare
- Education
- Finance
- E-commerce
- Agriculture

After selecting a domain, we identify a problem inside it.

Example:  
**Domain:** Education  
**Problem:** Predict student result

## 🧠 Traditional Model vs AI / ML Model

| Traditional Programming | AI / ML |
|----------------------|--------|
Rules written by humans | Rules learned from data |
No learning | Has learning |
Fixed output | Improves over time |

---

## 🎯 Learning Selection (AI-only Step)

Learning Selection means choosing **how the machine should learn**.

Types of Learning:
1. Supervised Learning
2. Unsupervised Learning
3. Semi-supervised Learning
4. Reinforcement Learning --> Not included

This step does not exist in traditional programming.

## 🧩 Basic ML Terminology

### 🔹 Input / Variable / Feature / Independent Variable

All these mean:
> Information given to the model to make predictions.

Examples:
- Study hours
- Attendance
- Age

---

### 🔹 Output / Label / Target / Dependent Variable

All these mean:
> What the model is trying to predict.

Examples:
- Pass / Fail
- House Price
- Disease Yes / No

---

### Relationship

```
Target = f(Features)
```

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Supervised Learning

### Definition

> Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where both the input and the correct output are known.

### Requirements

- Input data (Features)
- Output data (Labels)
- Labeled dataset
- Clear objective

### Example

| Study Hours | Attendance | Result |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| 6 | 90% | Pass |
| 3 | 60% | Fail |
| 8 | 95% | Pass |

### Types of Supervised Learning

1. **Classification** → Output is a category  
   Example: Spam / Not Spam

2. **Regression** → Output is a number  
   Example: House Price
