# Two Phases of Artificial Intelligence

AI development mainly consists of two major phases:

---

## Phase 1: Model Creation

Model creation is the process of building and training an AI model using data.

### Model Creation Contains:

1. Data Collection  
2. Data Preprocessing  
3. Input / Output Split  
4. Train and Test Set  

### Workflow

- Training Set → Model Creation  
- Model is tested using Test Set  
- Evaluate using Evolution Metrics  
- Save the Best Model  

### Output of this Phase

A trained and validated AI model ready for deployment.

---

## Phase 2: Deployment

Deployment is the phase where the trained model is used in real-world applications.

### Deployment Phase Steps:

1. Load the Model  
2. Accept User Input  
3. Predict Output  
4. Call to Action  

### Result

The AI model becomes live and starts serving real users.

### Summary

| Phase | Purpose |
|-----|-----|
| Model Creation | Build and train the AI model |
| Deployment | Use the trained model for predictions |

# Machine Learning Algorithms

Machine Learning algorithms can be categorized based on the type of problem they solve.  
Below are the most commonly used and important algorithms.

---

## Algorithms for Both Regression and Classification

These algorithms can be used for both numerical prediction and category prediction.

1. Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
2. Decision Tree  
3. Random Forest  

---

## Algorithms Only for Regression

These algorithms are used only when the output is a continuous numerical value.

1. Linear Regression  
2. Multiple Linear Regression  
3. Polynomial Regression  

---

## Algorithms Only for Classification

These algorithms are specifically used when the output is categorical.

1. Logistic Regression  
2. Naïve Bayes  
3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  

---

## Summary Table

| Category | Algorithms |
|--------|-----------|
| Regression & Classification | SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest |
| Regression Only | Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression |
| Classification Only | Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, KNN |

### Note

The above list contains the most important and widely used machine learning algorithms.  
There are still many other algorithms available in Machine Learning such as:

- Gradient Boosting  
- AdaBoost  
- XGBoost  
- Neural Networks  
- Deep Learning Models  
- Clustering Algorithms  
- Ensemble Methods  

These algorithms are also used based on different types of problems and requirements.
